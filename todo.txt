- Separate out web/python. Python will run as an independant daemon, and poll a DB (Redis?) for information. This removes some of the state-keeping neccessity that's a mess in Python.
- Redo build system for AVR properly - usitwislave doesn't belong to us, and we shouldn't keep it here.
- Software update/tagging mechanisim. AVRs have eeproms, let's use 'em.
	- Designate type of device, software version.
- Encryption of some sort betweeen outlets/master - not using wireless, doesn't matter.

- Wireless is messy. Can we do something at zero-crossing like powerline ethernet? Would bring cost down significantly.
	- What if user has multiple circuits?
	- Carrier wave & modulation. 

- Analog values
- Date/Time handler
- Digital outputs
	- Pushbullet at least!
